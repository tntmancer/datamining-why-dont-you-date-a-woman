# Final Project
This project includes a datset of 400 faces and precomputed face encodings for each. The main script is sheMissesMePrerun.py, which will compute and cache encodings for any faces in the face directory. sheMissesMeRandom.py loads random images and was used as a control for the project.
requirements.txt includes the requisite libraries for the project. It is recommended to run the project in a conda environment or venv to enforce package isolation.
